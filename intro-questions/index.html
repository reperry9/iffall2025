            <li>My name is Riley Perry, I am double majoring in Communication Design and Environmental Biology, with a minor in Geospatial Science, I am a junior.</li>
            <li>I chose to take this class becasue I have more experience on the design side of UI/UX and I wanted to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes with HTML, CSS, and code.</li>
            <li>I have no prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS</li>
            <li>I hope to learn about how the coding side of things interacts with visual design and how to build sites as a designer.</li>
            <li>Designing for the screen is different from designing for paper becasue there is a more interactive feature, allowing viewers to click buttons and links, scroll, and play motion or sound, as opposed to the more static paper design.</li>
            <li> I think the Noodles and Co. website exemplifies effective design due to its strong branding and intuative navigation. Visit the site here: <a href="https://www.noodles.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21798222394&gbraid=0AAAAAo5VfMrpkvxvzsLqj3FMy8xZ-RLY6&gclid=CjwKCAjw2brFBhBOEiwAVJX5GB4QYiIxZF-pVEbV55CLZwRhES5kRMCIyedRkketWaDhxaW4sTQDYRoCAy0QAvD_BwE"> Noodles and Co. Homepage </a>
            <li> I think the Pentagram website exemplifies effective communication due to its clear homepage with scrolling, dropdowns, and filters to communicate what the viewer is seeing. Visit the site here: <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/"> Pentagram Homepage </a>
            <li> I think the Spotify website exemplifies a site that works well due to its intuative layout and personalization features. Visit the site here: <a href="hhttps://open.spotify.com/"> Spotify Homepage </a>
